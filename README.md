# PaperNotes

This repo serves as a notebook for studying and reviewing papers. Github was chosen for its simplicity and accessibility. Gitbook is a second option since it has no official app. **The search function and tags make it extremely efficient for self-study. Each issue corresponds to one paper.**

However, there still remains two drawbacks: 1. hard to output and backup issues nicely. 2. unable to delete issues.

Papers mainly relates to areas of ML, NLP, RL and so on. Welcome any discussions.
